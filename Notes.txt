((P2X - R4X)/( R5X - R4X)) * (R5Y - R4Y) + RY4

1PSI = BAR * 14.504

Preassure - hard coded

Calibration Range - Result/Input/Number/Value (today in bar - may be psi later)
Sensitiviet - Result/Result/Scalar/Number/Value (today in pC/bar - may be psi later)
Linerality - Result/Result/Scalar/Number/Value

Sensor Temp - Result/Condition/Scalar/NUmber
Sensitivity Change - ???
